Summarization
Here’s a concise summary of the two defects identified in utf8_load_text_file, based solely on the code and reasoning you provided:

1. File‐handle leak  
   - fopen(path) is always called, but fclose(file) only appears inside the `if (0 == (*size) || file_size <= (*size))` branch.  
   - If that condition is false, execution falls through and returns without ever calling fclose, leaking the FILE*.

2. Undefined‐behavior on malloc failure  
   - Right after allocating with `malloc(1 + file_size)`, the code immediately does `memset(data, '\0', file_size)` without checking whether `data` is NULL.  
   - If malloc fails and returns NULL, invoking memset(NULL, …) is undefined behavior.

No other bugs have been asserted, and no assumptions or code beyond what you provided have been introduced.
