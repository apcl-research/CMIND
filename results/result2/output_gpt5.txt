Summarization
Summary of the issues found (based only on the provided code and reasoning):

1) Undefined-behavior bug (null-dereference via memset)
- Location: utf8_load_text_file.
- Relevant code pattern (as given): 
  - data = (utf8_char_t*)malloc(1 + file_size);
  - memset(data, '\0', file_size);  // called unconditionally, before testing data
  - if (data) { /* fread loop */ }
- Problem: memset is invoked on data without first checking whether malloc returned NULL. If malloc fails and returns NULL, calling memset(NULL, ...) is undefined behavior and can crash the program.
- Trigger condition (from supplied info): malloc returns NULL (out-of-memory).

2) Resource-leak bug (FILE* not always closed)
- Location: utf8_load_text_file.
- Relevant code pattern (as given):
  - FILE* file = fopen(path, "r");
  - if (file) {
        ... compute file_size ...
        if (0 == (*size) || file_size <= (*size)) {
            /* allocate, memset, fread, fclose(file) */
        }
    }
- Problem: fclose(file) is executed only inside the inner if block guarded by (0 == (*size) || file_size <= (*size)). If fopen() succeeds (file is non-NULL) but that inner condition is false, the function leaves the outer if block without ever calling fclose(file), leaking the open FILE* / file descriptor.
- Trigger condition (from supplied info): fopen succeeds and the inner condition (0 == (*size) || file_size <= (*size)) evaluates to false.

Consequences (as derivable from the provided information)
- The unconditional memset on the malloc result risks immediate undefined behavior (likely crash) when malloc fails.
- The missing fclose on some execution paths leads to file-descriptor/resource leaks when those paths are taken.

No other bugs or fixes are assumed or introduced beyond the provided code and reasoning.
