Summarization
Here’s a concise summary of the bug you’ve identified in the provided code:

1. Function at fault  
   Process_GetStringFromPeb in the driver code, which reads a UNICODE_STRING out of another process’s PEB.

2. What happens  
   – On every call it unconditionally allocates a “LocalBuffer” via Mem_Alloc.  
   – If the PEB-reading and copy logic succeeds, it stores LocalBuffer in *OutBuffer and returns.  
   – On any error or early-exit path (zero length, offsets exceed limits, Buffer NULL, exceptions in the __try block), it simply detaches and returns without ever calling Mem_Free on LocalBuffer.

3. Impact  
   Every failed or exceptional invocation leaks the LocalBuffer allocation. Over time (or under error-heavy workloads) this will consume nonpaged pool and may destabilize the driver or the system.

That is the core bug based solely on the code excerpts and your reasoning steps.
