Summarization
Here’s what the information tells us about the bug:

1. In trackingRememberKeys() we call  
   getKeysFromCommand(...,&result)  
   which on some commands (including PUBSUB) will allocate a heap buffer for result.keys.

2. Immediately after that, we check  
   if (executing->cmd->flags & CMD_PUBSUB) {  
       return;  
   }  
   This return happens before we ever call  
   getKeysFreeResult(&result),  
   so the heap buffer is never freed.

3. In the normal (non‐PUBSUB) path, we do call  
   getKeysFreeResult(&result)  
   at the end, which correctly frees the buffer.

4. Therefore the bug is a classic memory leak: whenever an executing command is marked with CMD_PUBSUB, trackingRememberKeys() returns early and skips the cleanup call.  

The fix is simply to invoke getKeysFreeResult(&result) before returning from the PUBSUB branch so that any heap memory allocated by getKeysFromCommand() is properly freed.
