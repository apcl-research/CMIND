REASONING METHODS: backward reasoning  
REASONING STEPS:  
1. The SIGSEGV backtrace points into DarwinProcess_scanThreads, so we start there.  
2. In the happy‐path the code calls task_threads(), getting back a buffer thread_list of thread_count entries.  
3. After iterating that list it calls vm_deallocate(mach_task_self(), (vm_address_t)thread_list, sizeof(thread_port_array_t) * thread_count).  
4. thread_port_array_t is a pointer‐type alias, so sizeof(thread_port_array_t) is just the size of a pointer (8 on ARM64), not the size of each thread_port element.  
5. That causes vm_deallocate to free the wrong number of bytes (8*count instead of the actual element size*count), corrupting heap metadata and leading to a crash on next access.  
Hypothesis: The call to vm_deallocate in DarwinProcess_scanThreads uses sizeof(thread_port_array_t) instead of the size of the actual array elements, causing an incorrect deallocation size and heap corruption.
Summarization
Here’s what the provided information tells us about the bug:

1. In DarwinProcess_scanThreads, after successfully calling task_threads() you get back:
   • thread_list – a buffer containing thread_count entries  
   • thread_count – the number of entries

2. When cleaning up, the code does:
     vm_deallocate(mach_task_self(),
                   (vm_address_t)thread_list,
                   sizeof(thread_port_array_t) * thread_count);
   but:
   • thread_port_array_t is just a pointer-type alias, so sizeof(thread_port_array_t) is the size of a pointer (8 bytes on ARM64), not the size of each thread_port element.
   • In reality each element is a mach_port_t (i.e. a thread port), whose true element size is not accounted for.

3. As a result, vm_deallocate is told to free only (pointer_size × count) bytes instead of (element_size × count) bytes. That under-deallocation corrupts heap metadata and typically causes a crash on the next heap operation.

In short: the call to vm_deallocate uses the wrong sizeof-argument (the size of the pointer type rather than the size of the array elements), leading to an incorrect deallocation length, heap corruption, and a downstream segmentation fault.
