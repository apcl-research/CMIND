Summarization
Here’s what the information tells us, distilled to the essentials:

1. Crash Location  
   - The ASAN report shows a segmentation fault in mSDLUpdateJoysticks() when handling an SDL_JOYDEVICEADDED event on Apple platforms under SDL 2.x.  
   - The faulting address is a read from offset +0x8 of a NULL pointer.

2. Root Cause  
   - SDL’s hot-plug event supplies event.jdevice.which, but in this case it is –1 (an invalid joystick index).  
   - That –1 goes straight into the helper _mSDLOpenJoystick(), which calls SDL_JoystickOpen(–1).  
   - SDL_JoystickOpen(–1) fails and returns NULL.  
   - Immediately afterward, the code assumes the returned pointer is non-NULL and does SDL_JoystickGetGUID(joystick->joystick) (i.e. dereferences joystick), triggering the SEGV.

3. Two Missing Guards  
   - There is no check that event.jdevice.which ≥ 0 before attempting to open it.  
   - There is no check that _mSDLOpenJoystick() returned non-NULL before dereferencing its result.

4. Symptom  
   - Any hot-plug event where SDL reports a negative device index will crash the application immediately rather than being gracefully ignored or logged as an error.

5. Suggested Fix (from the information given)  
   - In mSDLUpdateJoysticks(), before calling _mSDLOpenJoystick(events, event.jdevice.which), verify that event.jdevice.which is a valid index (≥ 0).  
   - After calling _mSDLOpenJoystick(), check whether the return value is NULL and bail out (or log/continue) instead of dereferencing it unconditionally.
