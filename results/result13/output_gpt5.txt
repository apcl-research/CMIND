Summary of bugs found in the provided code

1) Null-pointer dereference in SDL_JOYDEVICEADDED handling
- Location: mSDLUpdateJoysticks (SDL_JOYDEVICEADDED branch).
- Problem: Code calls struct SDL_JoystickCombo* joystick = _mSDLOpenJoystick(events, event.jdevice.which); then immediately dereferences joystick via joystick->joystick (passed to SDL_JoystickGetGUIDString/SDL_JoystickGetGUID) without checking whether joystick is NULL.
- Root cause: _mSDLOpenJoystick can return NULL (it returns NULL when SDL_JoystickOpen(i) fails). If it does, the unconditional dereference causes a crash (ASAN SEGV reading near zero page).

2) Invalid/negative device index used without validation
- Location: same SDL_JOYDEVICEADDED handling (the argument passed to _mSDLOpenJoystick).
- Problem: event.jdevice.which is passed directly into _mSDLOpenJoystick / SDL_JoystickOpen with no validation. The provided crash data shows event.jdevice.which == -1.
- Consequence: Passing -1 (or otherwise invalid indices) to SDL_JoystickOpen likely makes open fail (leading to the NULL return above) and also indicates the code should not assume event.jdevice.which is always a valid non-negative index.

3) Crash path (concise sequence of events observed)
- SDL_PeepEvents produces a SDL_JOYDEVICEADDED event whose jdevice.which is invalid (e.g. -1).
- _mSDLOpenJoystick is called with that invalid index and either fails to open or otherwise returns NULL.
- The returned pointer is not checked; code dereferences joystick->joystick to get a GUID string.
- Dereferencing NULL triggers ASAN SEGV (reading near zero page).

Additional notes from the provided code
- The unsafe behavior appears in instances of mSDLUpdateJoysticks shown in the paste (the same unchecked call/dereference pattern is present where SDL_JOYDEVICEADDED is handled).
- _mSDLOpenJoystick's implementation shows the clear failure path: it returns NULL if SDL_JoystickOpen(i) fails, so callers must handle NULL.

Minimal corrective actions (derived from the above only)
- Validate event.jdevice.which before using it (ensure it is a valid non-negative index).
- Check the return value of _mSDLOpenJoystick for NULL before dereferencing joystick or using its fields.

This summary is limited to the evidence and code you provided; I did not assume behavior beyond what the code and the stated crash symptoms show.
