Summarization
Here’s what the provided reasoning and code excerpt show:

1. In Settings_new(), the variable legacyDotfile is unconditionally allocated whenever “~/.htoprc” exists (via String_cat).  
2. The only place legacyDotfile gets freed is inside the “if primary‐read failed and fallback‐read succeeded” branch:  
     • if Settings_read(this, this->filename) fails but Settings_read(this, legacyDotfile) succeeds, then after writing out the new config the code calls free(legacyDotfile).  
3. If the primary read succeeds (the overwhelmingly common case), execution never enters that branch and legacyDotfile is never freed.  
4. Hence there is a one‐time leak of whatever String_cat allocated for legacyDotfile whenever you start htop with a normal first‐try config read.  

No other mismatches between allocation and deallocation were exposed by the supplied reasoning, so the outstanding bug here is simply that legacyDotfile is forgotten (and not freed) on the successful‐read path.
